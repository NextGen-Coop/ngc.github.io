              <p>Empowering Through Education</p> 
              <p>Hands-on learning and doing, mentored by seasoned professionals already in the industry.
                We will meet you where you are if you're willing to learn and want to offer assistance if you need equipment.
                Traditional boot camps and college courses are expensive and gatekeep tech education from low-income areas.
                We want to help remove those obstacles, and not just with our workers.
                We are planning on hosting computer literacy courses to teach our communities how to learn and teach themselves.

              <p>WorkerBee is a worker cooperative, which is an ownership structure where our workers are our owners.
                No outside shareholders who wouldn't know what DNS is even if we spelled it out for them. No C-level executives pushing profits over people.
                Just our workers making sure everyone's voices are heard.
                Choosing WorkerBee to carry your project is a good choice; at every level, we want you to succeed because your success is our success.</p>
