# Workerbee Tech Co-op Public Site
The public website for Workerbee Tech Co-op.

The organization and repositories will be updated with the new name once we've secured the domain name.

## Getting Started
First you need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Depending on your operating system this can either be super easy or super difficult. Check [the documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for help, 
or ask in Discord if you get stuck.

To contribute, you can clone the repo using `git clone git@github.com:NextGen-Coop/ngc-website.git` or by using the Github CLI tool `gh repo clone NextGen-Coop/ngc-website`.

Once you've cloned locally, you'll want to start the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) server by running `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` depending on how you install Jekyll.  You can then visit the local site at http://localhost:4000/.

If you need specific help with the way Jekyll sets up the site structure, please ask in Discord.
